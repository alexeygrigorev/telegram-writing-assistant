## Analysis of the Image

### Type
The image is a **screenshot**, likely from a spreadsheet or a table in a document, displaying a comparison of various database performance metrics.

### Main Content
The main content of the image is a table comparing the performance of different databases across several metrics:
- **Database**: The name or identifier of the database being tested.
- **QPS (Queries Per Second)**: A measure of the number of queries the database can handle per second.
- **P99 (ms)**: The 99th percentile of latency in milliseconds, indicating the latency at which 99% of queries were completed.
- **Recall@100**: A measure of the recall rate for retrieving relevant results, specifically for the top 100 results.

### Visible Text
The visible text in the table is as follows:

### Potential Use
This image might support an article or note comparing the performance of various databases, particularly focusing on their efficiency in handling queries, latency, and recall rates. It could be used in a technical analysis or benchmark report to help readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of each database system for specific use cases, such as high-performance applications, large-scale data retrieval, or applications requiring low latency.

Caption: benchmark data. Important differences: VDBBench numbers are multi-process concurrent QPS on dedicated cloud hardware (8-16 cores, 32-128 GB RAM, ~$1,000/month). sqlitesearch is serial single-process in pure Python on a single machine — no server, no dependencies beyond numpy. QPS is not directly comparable; recall and per-query latency are more meaningful for comparison.
