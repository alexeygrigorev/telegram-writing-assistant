### Analysis of the Image

#### 1. Type
The image appears to be a **screenshot**, likely from a presentation or a note-taking application.

#### 2. Main Content
The main content of the image is a table that lists different roles and their corresponding file paths. The table has two columns: "Agent" and "File". The roles listed are Product Manager, Software Engineer, Tester, and On-Call Engineer.

#### 3. Visible Text
```plaintext
Done. Agents are now:

| Agent             | File                                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Product Manager   | .claude/agents/product-manager.md          |
| Software Engineer | .claude/agents/software-engineer.md       |
| Tester            | .claude/agents/tester.md                  |
| On-Call Engineer  | .claude/agents/oncall-engineer.md         |
```

#### 4. Potential Use
This image might support an article or note about:
- **Agent Roles and Responsibilities**: A documentation page that outlines the different roles within a team, such as a product manager, software engineer, tester, and on-call engineer.
- **Configuration or Setup Guide**: A guide that details how to set up or configure agents within a system, with each role having a specific configuration file.
- **Project Management**: A project management note that lists team members' roles and their associated documentation or configuration files.

The image seems to be related to a project involving AI or automation, given the mention of "agents" and file paths in a format commonly used in coding and documentation.

Caption: I decided to rename the agents for the website. in the article where I mention them by names let's use the new names
