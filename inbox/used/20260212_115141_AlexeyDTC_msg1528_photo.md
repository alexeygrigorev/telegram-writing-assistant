Tier Structure

Following standard pricing psychology, a three-tier structure makes sense:

Tier 1: Basic
  • Lower price point
  • Community access
  • Basic content

Tier 2: Main offering
  • The target price point (around $35-50/month being considered)
  • Most members should land here
  • Maximum perceived value
  • Project work, content sharing, learning together

Tier 3: Premium
  • Higher price point
  • Makes Tier 2 look more reasonable by comparison
  • Could include courses or exclusive content
  • Limited time commitment from founder

The third tier serves an important psychological purpose: when presented with three options, people tend to choose the middle one. This is a standard pricing tactic recommended in business books.
