In general, I want to come up with a framework for people to help them discover problems that need
solving. So I want them to think about what kind of things require automation in what they do right
now. So I want to come up with a list of questions that you can ask them in order to identify the
problems they can solve with AI and automation and agents. This could be just opportunities for
automation, for opportunities for being more effective, but this could be also nice portfolio
projects because I think the best customer, as I said, the best customer is you yourself, right? So
if you have a problem and you want to solve this problem, then you will be the user and you will be
the most interested person in making this work, right? So you'll be your own customer. So this is
the ideal scenario. So yeah, let's, you can also already start putting some suggestions, like what
kind of questions we can ask, like and start putting together a framework for that.
