### Analysis of the Image

#### 1. Type
The image is a **screenshot** of a terminal or command prompt.

#### 2. Main Content
The main content shown is a discussion and execution of Terraform commands, specifically related to lifecycle management and preventing deletion of resources.

#### 3. Visible Text
```markdown
Yes, Terraform has lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true } which prevents deletion through Terraform. But note:
- deletion_protection = true (AWS level) - prevents deletion from anywhere (AWS console, API, Terraform)
- prevent_destroy = true (Terraform level) - only prevents terraform destroy

Let me apply the changes first:

Bash(cd /c/Users/alexe/git/infra-terraform && terraform plan 2>&1 | grep -A5 "Plan:")
Running...

Bash command
cd /c/Users/alexe/git/infra-terraform && terraform plan 2>&1 | grep -A5 "Plan:"
Run terraform plan
Do you want to proceed?
> 1. Yes
2. Yes, allow reading from infra-terraform\ from this project
