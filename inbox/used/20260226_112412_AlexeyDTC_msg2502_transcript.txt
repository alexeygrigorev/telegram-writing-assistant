So this was my reply to this person. So based on that, let's, we can structure it not as a reply,
but as a project idea and what exactly the agent should do there. Yeah. And then I will be adding
more and more ideas. Of course we can list the projects and this is what we should do. We should
list the projects that people will implement during AI build camp. So this is also a promotion to
the course because they are actually going to implement many of them, many projects, but also, yeah,
let's start collecting different ideas. So let's create an article for that.
