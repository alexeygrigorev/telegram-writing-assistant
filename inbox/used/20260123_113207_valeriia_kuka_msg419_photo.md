Voice Transcription with Grok

Using Grok's Whisper implementation for fast voice message transcription.

## Transcription Speed

I just added a function for the bot that outputs everything I say into the chat immediately, that is, it outputs the transcript to the chat. Transcription is done using Grok, and I'm surprised at how fast it is. I only finish recording a message and immediately see the transcript.

I just recorded a message a whole minute long, it was processed in 3-4 seconds. I just recorded it and immediately see the transcript. Telegram's built-in transcription works slowly. I'm very impressed at how fast and well the transcript from Whisper works.

## Cost

I'm using Grok for transcription. It's very cool. So far, everything is free, I don't pay anything for it. I don't need to run Whisper locally myself. That would, of course, take longer and not be as cool. I just send a request to Grok, and so far the free plan is sufficient. I don't know, I might eventually exceed the free tier, but for all the voice messages I've recorded so far, they were all transcribed for free.

## File Handling
