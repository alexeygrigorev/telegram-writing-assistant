What kind of mentoring you’re looking for?

Thanks for asking

I’m currently not getting many interview calls, and
I’d like to better position myself toward more tech-
focused companies rather than industrial environments
where I’ve worked so far.

I’m looking for both technical mentorship
(to sharpen my interview skills) and strategic guidance
on how to position my profile more effectively
