#### 4. Potential Use
This screenshot might support an article or note about:
- Setting up a new project in an IDE or a version control system.
- Using Git for version control in data science projects.
- The specifics of the GLM-5 model or its integration into a project.
- Best practices for initializing and documenting projects in data science.
