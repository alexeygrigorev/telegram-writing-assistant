### Analysis of the Image

#### **1. Type**
- **Type**: screenshot

#### **2. Main Content**
- The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen with a file explorer on the left and a code editor on the right.
- The file explorer appears to be part of a project directory named `AI-ENGINEERING-BUILD CAMP`, which includes folders like `v2`, `email-course`, and files such as `create_structure.py` and various Markdown files.
- The code editor displays a Python script named `create_structure.py`, which defines a folder structure using a dictionary named `STRUCTURE`.

#### **3. Visible Text**
```python
# Folder structure definition
STRUCTURE = {
    "01-foundation": [
        "01-overview",
        "02-preparation",
        "03-foundation",
        "04-advanced-search",
        "05-alternatives",
        "homework",
    ],
    "02-advanced-rag": [
        "01-overview",
        "02-faq-assistant",
        "03-youtube",
        "04-elasticsearch",
        "05-qdrant",
        "homework",
    ],
    "03-agents": [
        "01-overview",
        "02-agent-basics",
```
#### **4. Potential Use**
- This screenshot might support an article or note about:
  - Setting up a project structure for an AI engineering course or curriculum.
  - Automating the creation of a directory structure using Python.
  - Organizing educational content, specifically for an AI or machine learning course.
  - Using Markdown files (`curriculum.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) for documentation within a project.
