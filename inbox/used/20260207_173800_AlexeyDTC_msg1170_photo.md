General Course-Related Questions

I just discovered the course. Can I still join?
Yes, but if you want to receive a certificate, you need to submit your project while we're still accepting submissions.

Course: I have registered for the LLM Zoomcamp. When can I expect to receive the confirmation email?
You don't need it. You're accepted. You can also just start learning and submitting homework (while the form is open) without registering. It is not checked against any registered list. Registration is just to gauge interest
