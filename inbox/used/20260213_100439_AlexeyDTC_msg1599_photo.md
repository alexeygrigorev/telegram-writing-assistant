Response

Plan: Microboost - Windows Microphone Booster

Tech Stack: Tauri 2.0 + Rust + Svelte

Why: Produces tiny standalone exe (~3-5MB), native performance, clean modern UI, no runtime dependencies

Architecture

microboost/
  src-tauri/  # Rust backend
  src/
    main.rs     # App entry
    audio.rs    # WASAPI integration (mic listing, volume control)
    recorder.rs # Audio recording to WAV/MP3
```

#### 4. Potential Use
