Interesting Resources

* Claude Code and Large-Context Reasoning: materials from a hands-on O'Reilly Live Learning course by Tim Warner that teaches how to build production-ready AI-assisted development workflows with Claude Code. It covers large-context reasoning, MCP-based persistent memory, agents, and custom skills, with practical examples for code review, automation, and CI/CD.

* awesome-slash: a curated GitHub list of tools, patterns, and projects built around slash-command interfaces. It's a practical reference for anyone designing command-driven workflows, bots, or developer tools that rely on concise, action-oriented commands instead of complex UIs.
