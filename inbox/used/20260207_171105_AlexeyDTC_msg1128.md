# Use Case: RAG for Content Management

We've used RAG to answer questions. But RAG isn't just for question-answering. What else is it for?

RAG is useful whenever you need to work with large collections of documents and make intelligent decisions about them. Let's look at how [the FAQ repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq) uses RAG to triage new proposals.


## The FAQ Contribution Flow

When someone wants to add a question to the FAQ, they create an issue on GitHub with the `faq-proposal` label. Here's what happens automatically:

1. User creates an issue with the `faq-proposal` label
2. GitHub Actions triggers the `faq-automation.yml` workflow
3. The workflow fetches the issue body (question and answer)
4. A RAG agent searches the existing FAQ for similar questions
5. An LLM makes a decision: NEW, UPDATE, or DUPLICATE
6. Based on the decision:
   - NEW or UPDATE: A branch is created, the FAQ file is added/updated, and a pull request is opened
   - DUPLICATE: A comment is posted explaining why, and the issue is closed
7. A human reviews the pull request and merges it


## How the RAG Agent Works

The FAQ agent is in `faq_automation/rag_agent.py`. Here's the decision model it uses:

- `action` - NEW, UPDATE, or DUPLICATE
- `rationale` - 1-2 sentences explaining the decision
- `document_id` - The FAQ entry to act on
- `section_id` - Which section this belongs to
- `section_rationale` - Why this section was chosen
- `order` - Where in the section this FAQ should appear
- `question` - The final question text
- `proposed_content` - The merged answer (for NEW and UPDATE)
- `filename_slug` - File-system friendly slug (for NEW)

You can see the full implementation at [github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq_automation/rag_agent.py](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/blob/main/faq_automation/rag_agent.py).


## The Decision Process

The RAG agent searches the FAQ index using the proposed question as the query. It finds the most similar existing FAQ entries and returns them as context for the LLM.

The LLM then decides:

- NEW - Create a new FAQ file. The question isn't covered by existing entries.
- UPDATE - Merge into an existing FAQ. The question adds meaningful information to an existing entry.
- DUPLICATE - The question is already fully answered. No changes needed.

For NEW and UPDATE, the agent also merges the answers and generates proper markdown formatting. For code, it wraps identifiers in backticks and uses fenced code blocks.


## Why This Matters

This is RAG applied beyond simple question-answering:

- Content triage - Automatically deciding where new content belongs
- Deduplication - Identifying when a proposal is already covered
- Content merging - Combining new information with existing answers
- Maintaining structure - Ensuring FAQs go in the right section and order

The human still reviews the pull request, but RAG handles the repetitive work of searching, comparing, and organizing.


## Other RAG Applications

RAG is useful wherever you need to work with large collections of documents:

- Customer support - Routing tickets to the right team, suggesting responses
- Recommendation systems - Finding similar products, articles, or documents
- Research assistance - Literature review, finding related papers
- Fact-checking - Verifying claims against a knowledge base
- Code assistance - Searching codebases for relevant examples
- Education - Creating study materials or quizzes from content
- Writing assistance - Suggesting related content to include

The pattern is the same: search for relevant context, then use an LLM to process that context for a specific task.


## Key Takeaway

RAG systems can be powerful tools for content operations:

- They can process submissions faster than manual review
- They maintain consistency in how decisions are made
- They free up humans to focus on quality rather than repetitive tasks

The FAQ system shows RAG working as part of a real pipeline - not just answering questions, but helping build and maintain the knowledge base itself.
