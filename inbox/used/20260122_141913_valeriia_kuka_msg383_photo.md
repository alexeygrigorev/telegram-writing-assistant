## Analysis of the Image

### Type
The image is a **screenshot** of a GitHub page displaying a Markdown document.

### Main Content
The main content of the image appears to be a course outline for an AI Bootcamp titled "From RAG to Agents." The course is a 6-week program designed to take students from core AI concepts to production-grade AI systems.

### Visible Text
```markdown
The AI Bootcamp "From RAG to Agents" course is a comprehensive 6-week program that takes students from core concepts to production-grade AI systems. The first iteration had 49 participants, and their feedback was incorporated into an updated syllabus[3].

Course Structure

The course is redesigned with 90% of materials re-recorded based on prior cohort feedback. It's longer but less dense, and more focused.

Week 1 covers LLMs and RAG foundations:
* Course overview and logistics
* Environment preparation with GitHub Codespaces
* AI-assisted development tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Antigravity)
* OpenAI API basics and responses
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) introduction
* Building a document assistant with RAG
* Structured output and vector search
* Alternatives to OpenAI (Groq, Anthropic, Gemini, Z.ai)
* Advanced chunking techniques

Week 2 is a buffer week for environment setup, with optional content on other use cases and external databases.

Week 3 focuses on agents:
* Introduction to agents and agentic RAG
* Agent tool-call loop foundation
* Pydantic AI framework
* Multi-agent systems (linear execution, agents as tools)
```
