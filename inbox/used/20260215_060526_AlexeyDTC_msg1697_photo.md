## Analysis of the Image

### Type
The image is a **photo** or more specifically, a screenshot of two certificate designs side by side.

### Main Content
The main content of the image shows two different designs for a **Certificate of Completion**. The certificates appear to be for a workshop titled "Building Your Own Coding Assistant from Scratch."

### Visible Text
The visible text on the certificates includes:

```text

The recreated version on the right has a slight variation with the instructor's name in all caps:

```text
