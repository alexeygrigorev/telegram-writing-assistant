#### **3. Visible Text**
```plaintext
AI Engineer Role in 2026 - Event Series
3-part live series • Virtual (Zoom) • Free

WHAT WE'RE COVERING
What the role entails, how companies run
interviews, and how take-home assignments are
assessed.

SESSION 1 - DEFINING THE ROLE
Tue, Feb 24, 2026 • 5:00 PM CET
Insights from 1,500+ job descriptions
AI engineers vs. ML researchers
A typical day in the role

SESSION 2 - THE INTERVIEW PROCESS
Tue, Mar 3, 2026 • 5:00 PM CET
Interview questions from recent candidates
Explaining architecture and model choices
Coding and system design tasks

SESSION 3 - TAKE-HOME ASSIGNMENTS
Mon, Mar 9, 2026 • 6:00 PM CET
Examples from Q4 2025 and Q1 2026
What reviewers look for
End-to-end document processing task

hired for 'AI engineer' roles twice. the job
description said RAG and embeddings. the job
turned out to be 80% prompt engineering + glue
code + monitoring. the 1500 JDs probably have the
same problem - they describe ambition, not what
you do all day
```
