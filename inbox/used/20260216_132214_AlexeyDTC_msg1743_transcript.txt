Yeah, I was talking about RAC. So for RAC we need to have this pipeline, right? So we need to run it
reliably. But then also, let's say we have an agent, right? So for agents, we need to know tool
calling and things like that, right? So and when we have tools, we need to make sure that agents can
use these tools reliably. So we need to be able to write tests for tools. and for the agent
behavior, right? And then with these tools, everything becomes more complex. So we need to be able
to, we need to be able to, yeah, adjust our, write our tests and write our evaluation, update our
evaluation framework, evaluation criteria in such a way that we, okay, in this scenario, these tools
are used, right? So agent must use these tools in this scenario, things like that, right? So in
simple case, we saw that it's already a lot of work, but in more complex cases, when we have RAC,
when we have agents, the complexity is, I don't know, 10 times more than before. So all these things
are solved by AI engineers.
