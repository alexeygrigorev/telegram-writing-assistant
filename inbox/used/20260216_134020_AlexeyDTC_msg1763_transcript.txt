Okay, so I'm looking at the article we wrote before, Chris DM for AI. So here, data understanding,
we need to understand what data we have available. So in case of machine learning, of course, we
need to train our model. So without data, we cannot do anything. But here, it's equally important
because we need to send something to AI, right? And do we have everything we need for that? Yeah, so
we wanna understand like how difficult it would be to integrate what we need. In case of our, in our
example, when we send data to AI, we need to make sure that the front end can send all the data,
right, that we need. That's one thing. But let's say we are talking about integrating AI into
something else. It could be, yeah, Yeah, let's think, we can think what else, because sometimes you
run things on the backend, this is not user facing thing, right? So you can use AI to optimize some
processes, right? And there it's very important that you have some data for AI to act on, because it
needs to get in some data. So in our case, the input will be picture, right? Of course, yeah, in our
case, it's easy. We already have the picture. But then another thing is like, how are we going to
evaluate this, right? Do we have... Okay, let's think of this more, but I'll go to the next step.
