We are talking about data preparation steps. So here we need to prepare data in such a way that we
can add, put this into the model. In our case, it's an image, it's text. This is fairly simple. So
we just fetch whatever image was sent to us from the front-end. We send it to OpenAI, we process, we
get data, and we send it back. So there is not much data pre-processing, there is not much modeling
step, but for the modeling step here, I would classify it, I would change it a little. So there, in
case of ML, here we do the actual training, here we train the actual model, right? So here we also
evaluate the model. So we do cross validation, we do all these sorts of things. So here modeling is,
it's of course here. So here we have the prompt here we have our output class Right so this pydentic
model Then we have input and then we set up the validation framework we set up the tests for our AI
system right, so and then we need to collect this evaluation data, we need to evaluate our model, so
this is a process that is very similar to what we would do with the machine learning, but except we
don't train the model, we try to, we have other criteria, we have other things we are optimizing,
right? But the important thing here is that we have a metric that is not necessarily a business
metric, but more like technical metric for how many images we are able to extract this thing, right?
And then we change our prompt, we tune our prompt, we do other things, right? And on the after that,
we are ready for evaluation. And here, important thing in CRIFDM, also for machine learning,
evaluation that we do with cross-validation and metrics like accuracy is not evaluation in CRIFDM.
So this belongs to the modeling step. So let's talk about evaluation now.
