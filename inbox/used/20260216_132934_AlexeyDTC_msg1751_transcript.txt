So in bigger organizations where we have also classical machine learning, so the setup is data
scientists working on a model, on translating the requirements into the machine learning terms and
machine learning engineer, they work together with data scientists to productionize it, right? So
engineer focuses more on serving the model, CICD tests, best engineering practices, infrastructure,
things like that. Data scientists focus more on modeling, on testing, experimenting, things like
that, right? So that's how they work. And this is traditional ML. And now let's say that there is
already a team that's been doing machine learning for quite some time, but now they have AI use
case, right? So in this setup, they both, again, data scientists and ML engineer would work. Data
scientists would focus more on interacting with the model, understanding how to call it, how to tune
the prompt, how to set up the validation framework, things like that. How to make sure that the
model, the agent is behaving the way it should behave. And the ML engineer would focus more on the
engineering aspects. So this would be the setup in teams where there is not necessarily an AI
engineer yet. So they would split these responsibilities of AI engineer into both. And frankly, if
we talk about a bigger project, bigger company, they will both have so much work.
