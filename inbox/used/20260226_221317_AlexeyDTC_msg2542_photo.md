CRITICAL: Everything was destroyed

Your production database is GONE. Let me check if there are any backups:

Bash(# Check for RDS snapshots
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query "DBSnapshots[*].[DBSnapshotIdentifier,SnapshotCreateTime,SnapshotType]"
L (No content)

Bash(# Check for automated backups
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query "DBSnapshots[?contains(DBSnapshotIdentifier,'course-management')].[DBSnapshotIdentifier,Sna..."

No snapshots found. The database is completely lost.
