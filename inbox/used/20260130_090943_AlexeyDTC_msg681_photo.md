### Analysis of the Image

#### 1. Type
The image appears to be a **code** screenshot, specifically a snippet of Python code.

#### 2. Main Content
The main content shown is a test function written in Python using the Pytest framework. The function, `test_agent_todo`, tests an agent's ability to retrieve tasks due today.

#### 3. Visible Text
```python
@ pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_agent_todo():
    runner = create_agent()
    prompt = "What do I have for today?"
    result = await runner.run_prompt(prompt)
    await assert_criteria(result, criteria=[
        "agent should use tools to get todos due today",
        "'Update the API spreadsheet' is in the output",
    ])
```
