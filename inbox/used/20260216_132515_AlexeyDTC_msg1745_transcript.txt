Okay and let's compare this role with ML engineers. I mentioned before ML engineer and the role, the
task of an ML engineer is to integrate machine learning into the product. and the task of AI
engineers is to integrate AI into the product. What's the difference? The difference between
traditional AI, traditional machine learning and AI is, well, typically if we talk about LLM
providers, then the difference is that you already have an LLM, you just call the web service versus
actually having the weights own in the model, right? In some cases, yes, we have open source LLMs.
There are cases where you need to serve the LLM yourself. So then this becomes your responsibility
as AI engineer too. In traditional ML, it's always the responsibility of the ML engineer to actually
serve the model.
