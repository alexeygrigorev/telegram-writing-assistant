How to Improve Your Claude Code Workflow

1. Give It Memory
- At the start of every session, read your memory file before responding to my first message.
- Save my preferences as you learn them. When I correct you, persist the correction immediately. Don't wait for me to say save.
- Without this, every session starts from zero. You re-explain your stack, your style, your rules every single time.

2. Build a System That Scales
- Keep the memory index under 60 lines. If a topic needs more than 2 lines, create a linked file: lessons.md, preferences.md, [project].md.
- When I say save memory, categorize each item and route it to the right file automatically.
- Every 10 sessions, deduplicate and condense all memory files. Prune anything outdated.

3. Build Multi-Agent Teams
- You are the coordinator. Use Codex for code tasks and a research model for writing. Write a plan file before launching any worker. Review every file they create or modify.
- One model doing everything sequentially is slow. Two workers in parallel, split by domain, is fast.
- The coordinator never writes code. It plans, delegates, and reviews. That's the whole job.

4. Show Work
- Never go silent for more than 60 seconds. Print what phase you're in before and after every step. If something fails, show the exact error.
- Long tasks fail silently. You don't know if it's stuck, crashed, or just slow. Phase markers before and after each step. When it dies, you know exactly where.

5. Automate Workflows
- Save this prompt as a slash command called /[name]. When I type /[name], run the full sequence end to end without stopping for approval.
- If you type the same 5-step prompt more than twice, it should be a single command. Compound workflows turn 20 minutes of prompting into one line.

6. Let Claude Maintain Itself
- Run memory maintenance every X days. Deduplicate entries, prune stale references, keep all files under their line limits.
- Scheduled cleanup means your workspace stays organized without you touching it. Cron jobs, log rotation, automated dedup.
- Without maintenance, memory files bloat, old context piles up, and quality degrades over time.

Tips
- Start small: Get memory working on one project first. Once it sticks, layer on workflows and automation.
- Version your rules: Put your instructions file in git. When something breaks, you can diff what changed.
