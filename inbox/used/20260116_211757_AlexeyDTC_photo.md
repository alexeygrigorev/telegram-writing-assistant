Type: code or terminal.

Content: A list of requirements for processing voice notes, including translating, categorizing, and formatting text, and a bash command to create a directory.

Text:
```
Based on the transcripts, here's the analysis and plan:

Requirements from voice notes:
1. /process checks inbox/raw/ for uncommitted materials
2. Translates to English (voice notes are in Russian/mixed)
3. Categorizes into existing articles or creates new ones
4. Clean formatting: no bold, no --- separators, short sentences
5. Each article tracks source materials for cleanup
6. Move processed files to inbox/used/
7. Delete .ogg files (keep only transcripts)
8. Trim whitespace from transcripts
9. Commit and push to git

Let me create the command file and update the bot:

Bash( mkdir -p .clause/commands)
L (No content)
```

Context: This appears to be a plan for automating a process of processing voice notes, likely for a personal or project-specific use case.
