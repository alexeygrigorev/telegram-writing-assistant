## Analysis of the Image

### Type
The image appears to be a **code** or a **screenshot of code**, likely from a presentation or a document discussing AI engineering use cases.

### Main Content
The main content of the image discusses two dominant patterns in AI engineering:

1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to data sources such as documents and databases.
2. Agents - LLMs that utilize tools to accomplish tasks.

### Visible Text
```markdown
## Key Insight: RAG + Agents = 70%+ of Use Cases

The two dominant patterns are:
- RAG - Connect LLMs to your data (documents, databases)
- Agents - LLMs that use tools to accomplish tasks

If you learn these two patterns deeply, you can handle most AI Engineering use cases.
```
