## Analysis of the Image

### Type
The type of the image is a **screenshot**, likely from a text-based interface such as a terminal, email, or a support chat.

### Main Content
The main content of the image appears to be a support response regarding the accidental deletion of an RDS Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. The response confirms the deletion and provides information on a potential recovery effort using a remaining snapshot.

### Visible Text
```text
After reviewing the case notes, I understand that you have accidentally deleted your RDS Aurora PostgreSQL cluster "dev-course-management-cluster" along with its snapshots, and you are seeking assistance with the recovery effort.

Using the internal tools at my disposal, I have confirmed the cluster deletion with the below API call (2026-02-26 22:02:04 UTC):

{
"skipFinalSnapshot": true,
"deleteAutomatedBackups": true,
"dbclusterIdentifier": "dev-course-management-cluster"
}

Looking into your account, I can see that the following snapshot was not deleted and is available to restore your cluster:
