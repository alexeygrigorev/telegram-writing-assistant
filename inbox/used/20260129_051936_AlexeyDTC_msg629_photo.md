#### 3. Visible Text
```text
I would like to thank Alexey Grigorev and the ML Zoomcamp team for making this course freely available.
The journey was often challenging - I had zero math knowledge at the beginning and no experience in git and github (deployment still comes to me in nightmares), and I had to learn everything along the way and really quickly, but also it was genuinely fun and deeply rewarding.
```

#### 4. Potential Use
This image might support an article or note about:
