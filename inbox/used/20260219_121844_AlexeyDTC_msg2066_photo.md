## Analysis of the Image

### Type
The image appears to be a **screenshot** of a document or note, likely from a computer screen.

### Main Content
The main content of the image is a list of guidelines or principles for **workflow orchestration**, **task management**, and **core principles** in a technical or software development context.

### Visible Text
The visible text in the image is already provided in a clear format. Here it is again for reference:

```
## Workflow Orchestration
### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
Never mark a task complete without proving it works
Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
Zero context switching required from the user
Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
###
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
```

### Potential Use
This image might support an article or note on **best practices for software development**, **workflow optimization**, or **productivity tips for developers**. It could also be part of a **guide for junior developers** or a **checklist for code reviews**. The content seems to emphasize the importance of planning, verification, elegance, and continuous improvement in a development workflow.

Caption: Давай добавим это в статью про библиотеку .cloud как потенциальное улучшение. Нужно записать идеи по тому, что там можно сделать дальше.
