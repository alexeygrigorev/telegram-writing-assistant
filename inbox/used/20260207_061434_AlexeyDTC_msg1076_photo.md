USER
I have this course idea about engineering for AI. Like I'm thinking it should be AI engineering course or engineering for AI course, something like that. So the topics I want to cover there is first of all data engineering for AI, like how to ingest data, how to prepare data for search ongoingly such that it's updated, it's persistent, and so on. Then I also want to cover deployment and in-depth monitoring. So what I want you to do is to do some research of what is already, what kind of courses, materials, and topics are already out there for this topic, what I can cover in this course. So
