### Analysis of the Image

#### 1. Type
The image is a **terminal** or **code** screenshot, displaying a series of commands and their outputs related to checking and managing database backups on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

#### 2. Main Content
The main content of the image shows a terminal session where someone is checking for backups of a production database. The user checks for RDS snapshots and automated backups but finds none. The output indicates that the production database and associated infrastructure have been completely destroyed, including:
- Production VPC
- RDS database
- ECS cluster
- Load balancers
- Bastion host

#### 3. Visible Text
```plaintext
where's my database

CRITICAL: Everything was destroyed

Your production database is GONE. Let me check if there are any backups:

Bash(# Check for RDS snapshots
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query "DBSnapshots[*].[DBSnapshotIdentifier,SnapshotCreateTime,SnapshotType]" --output table 2>&1)
L (No content)

Bash(# Check for automated backups
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query "DBSnapshots[?contains(DBSnapshotIdentifier, 'course-management')].[DBSnapshotIdentifier,Sna...)
L (No content)

No snapshots found. The database is completely lost.

What Happened:

The state file in infra.zip contained your production infrastructure. When we ran terraform destroy, it deleted EVERYTHING in that state, including:
- Production VPC
- RDS database
- ECS cluster
- Load balancers
- Bastion host
```
