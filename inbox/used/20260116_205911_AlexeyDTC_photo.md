Content: A summary of a personal knowledge management system project.

Text:
```
I see the project. Here's a summary of the idea:

Telegram -> GitHub Article Assistant

A personal knowledge management system where you:
1. Send thoughts to Telegram (text, voice, images)
2. Bot saves everything locally to inbox/raw/
3. Voice messages are transcribed via Groq Whisper
4. Command /process triggers Claude Code to:
- Analyze accumulated materials
- Update existing articles or create new ones
- Commit to GitHub
- Send commit link back to Telegram
```

Context: This might be useful for project planning, documentation, or communication about a personal knowledge management system that integrates with Telegram and GitHub.
