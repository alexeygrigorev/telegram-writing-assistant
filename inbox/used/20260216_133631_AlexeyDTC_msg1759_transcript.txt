And also here the role of AI engineer would be to work with product manager to understand do we
actually need AI here or there is something simpler we can do, right? So previously for machine
learning, because machine learning is building a machine learning model is more expensive, takes
more time, right? So there sometimes you could solve the problem by using like rules. Here in case
of AI, yeah, testing hypothesis is cheaper, but we still need to understand, cheaper in sense of
time. We still need to understand if it's worth solving with AI or we have something else. We can
use something else.
