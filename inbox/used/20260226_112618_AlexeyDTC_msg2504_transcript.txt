I just had another idea. So you can implement an agent that creates you, helps you identify agents
that you can do. So probably kind of similar to remember this kid parent stuff, so the kid, these
clout slash commands that we wrote about in Substack. Yeah, so for that we can create something that
helps people select nice projects, simple projects like an agent that is like I don't know what
exactly kind of tools this agent will need to have. Could be just simple conversational agent, like
not really an agent, like just a chatbot that helps people come up with original ideas. That's also
a very nice idea. First of all, it's a nice project idea, but then And it's also a nice project for
us to have in the community where, yeah, people can try playing with this. And by the way, so this
could be actually a good lead magnet for the community. So they will have to sign up to interact
with the agent. And then the agent can suggest different ideas. Oh, that's actually really nice.
