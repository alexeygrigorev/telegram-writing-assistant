### Analysis of the Image

#### 1. Type
- **Type**: This appears to be a **screenshot** of a Markdown document, likely from a GitHub repository.

#### 2. Main Content
- **Main Content**: The main content discusses the automation of creating course materials, specifically homework assignments and course plans, using a Claude agent. The agent interacts with a course management platform API to automate tasks that previously required manual intervention.

#### 3. Visible Text
```markdown
Course Material Automation

Beyond the platform development, I've also automated the creation of course materials. Previously, creating homework assignments and course plans required 20-30 minutes of clicking in the admin interface for each course.

I created a Claude agent with skills describing how to interact with the course management platform API. Now I can describe what I want in text format - which homework assignments to create, what deadlines they should have - and the agent makes the POST requests and sends me a URL to review[4].

This same approach works for creating individual homework assignments. My previous workflow:

1. Write homework in a Markdown document
2. Push to repository
3. Open the platform admin interface
4. Manually enter questions and answers (5-10 minutes)

Now I can tell the agent: "Here's a markdown document with homework, please create the homework form." Done[5].
```

#### 4. Potential Use
- **Potential Use**: This screenshot could support an article or note about **automating educational tasks**, specifically how to use AI agents like Claude to streamline the creation of course materials and homework assignments. It might fit into a broader discussion on **edtech innovations**, **automation in education**, or **using AI in course management**.

Caption: Feedback:

While Course Material Automation is raleted to telegram-writing-assistant/articles
/claude-code-experiments.md because it’s an experiment with Claude Code, you should put it into a separate file.

We want each article to focus on one topic and avoid groupping several topics under one topical article
