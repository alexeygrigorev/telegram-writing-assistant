## Analysis of the Image

### Type
The image is a **screenshot** of a webpage, specifically a GitHub page displaying a Markdown file.

### Main Content
The main content of the image shows a section of a website services page, focusing on a new "Workshops" section. It includes an overview of the workshops offered, which are hands-on for engineering teams. The workshops cover topics such as:

- **LLMs & Prompt Engineering**: Practical deep dives into Large Language Models, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and AI agents. Teams will build working systems, not just learn theory.
- **AI Dev Tools**: Teaching teams to effectively use AI assistants and modern development workflows. From prompt engineering to building custom AI tools.

### Visible Text
```markdown
New Website Services Section

As part of preparing for future consulting and workshop work, I added a new "Workshops" section to my website. The content is currently AI-generated but will be updated with real testimonials and project examples[2].

Workshops
I deliver hands-on workshops for engineering teams. Drawing from experience creating ML Zoomcamp, LLM Zoomcamp, and AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp - courses taken by 100,000+ students worldwide.

What I Can Help With

LLMs & Prompt Engineering
Practical deep dives into Large Language Models, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and AI agents. Your team will build working systems, not just learn theory.

AI Dev Tools
Teaching teams to effectively use AI assistants and modern development workflows. From prompt engineering to building custom AI tools.
