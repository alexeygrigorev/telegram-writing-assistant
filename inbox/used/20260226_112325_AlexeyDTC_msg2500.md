If you don't have any ideas, I have one for a project I personally need right now.

I have many different GitHub projects, and sometimes I have an idea for something I want to implement while I'm on the go and away from my computer. Currently, I have to open GitHub on my phone, select the right project, select an issue template if required, and manually describe what I want to do.

Instead of doing that manually, I want to be able to send a voice message to a Telegram bot that creates the issue for me automatically. Here is how it would work:

1. Setup: You define a specific bunch of repositories, or perhaps all of your repositories, that the agent should be interested in.
2. Interaction: You send a voice note to a Telegram bot.
3. Processing: The bot transcribes the voice note, and based on your command, the agent performs an action like creating or editing an issue.
4. Categorization: If the agent cannot categorize an issue, it could record it in a "not categorized" list for you to review later at home. You could then correct the agent by telling it which repository the issue actually belongs to.

This is just a suggestion, so you don't have to implement it. If you like the idea, you can run with it; if not, we can brainstorm and I can suggest something else.
