One of the students from AIBuild.com just wrote me asking if I can give him a suggestion for a
course project. He doesn't have any ideas and he wants to work on something like something that is,
I don't know, something like, let me check how he actually wrote it. specific customer or business
requirement rather than the one he defines himself. In my opinion, the best customer for these kind
of projects is you yourself, but I know that sometimes you don't really have ideas. That's why I
want to start an article where I suggest ideas that people can use for implementing their agents. or
like for upskilling in the core AI engineering skills.
