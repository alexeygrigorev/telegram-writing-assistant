Data preparation step is in case of machine learning, we just need to fetch the data from different
sources. We need to prepare it in the right format. So for this particular case, it's less
important, but let's say if we wanna use AI for recommendations or search or things like that, of
course we need to have data available. And yeah, by the way, we can also mention that in the
previous section that in some cases, and where we want to integrate into products like and things
like search, recommendation, we need to be able to access this data, right? So, and then add a to do
there to brainstorm on that a little bit of what kind of other projects, like how can this step look
like for other projects, for other things.
