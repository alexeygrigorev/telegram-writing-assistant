### Analysis of the Image

#### **1. Type**
The image is a **screenshot** of a terminal or command-line interface.

#### **2. Main Content**
The main content of the image appears to be a PostgreSQL database query session and a command-line deployment command. It includes:
- A PostgreSQL session where a user `pgusr` connects to the database "prod".
- A SQL query to count the number of rows in the `courses_answer` table.
- The result of the query, indicating there are **1,943,200** rows.
- A command-line deployment command using `claude`.

#### **3. Visible Text**
```plaintext
