So as you can see, even for this simplest example, there are so many things that need to happen. So
it's not enough to just define this PyIdentic class, send it to OpenAI and call it today. There is a
lot of things that need to happen to properly integrate this into the product. And we didn't even
talk about the UI changes, right? Because there also need to be UI changes. So typically I would say
front-end engineers do this, but in some cases, if you work at a startup, AI engineers might also do
that. Because with tools like with AI assistance, now it doesn't really matter if your TypeScript
knowledge is not the best, right? So with Cloud Assistant, with Cloud Code or things like that, AI
engineers or any engineer for that matter, can make these changes, they can integrate this into the
product. But typically in bigger companies, it would be a front-end engineer.
