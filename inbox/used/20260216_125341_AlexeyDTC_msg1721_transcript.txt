Okay, now I want to rehearse a little for our upcoming event today that I have about Day of AI
Engineer. So in that there I'll talk about defining the AI engineering role, how AI engineers
collaborate with others and about processes. so we already i think have a few articles about that so
analyze these articles and this is going to be probably a long quest message or a bunch of messages
so uh i have two goals right now so first i wanna rehearse what i'm saying and second is i wanna
update the materials that we already have about these rules so i'm going to start with uh
understanding the course of responsibilities of of the AI engineering role. How this position
bridges the gap between software engineering and ML research. Let me actually try to find what I
already have because I frankly don't remember. I need to now think what I'm going to say. The core
responsibilities and how this position bridges. So basically this, we are talking about the role of
the AI engineer. And what I wanna start with is I want to go to our DataTalks.club, and I wanna open
articles and data roles. We have an article about roles, data team roles explained. I'm going to
send this now to our chat. Yeah, let me stop right now.
