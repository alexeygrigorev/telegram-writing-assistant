So there are many tools for serving LLMs, like VLLM, but it doesn't really matter. Like the tools
are secondary, just knowing that, okay, you need to do this. And then they require special hardware.
And then you also need to know how to provision infrastructure for this hardware, right? So
typically this is also on the AI engineer, right? For a male engineer, it could be similar because
like, let's say you need to serve a neural network model, right? the difference is that LLMs require
a lot more power, a lot more like bigger GPUs. So yeah, this is the main difference with ML
engineers.
