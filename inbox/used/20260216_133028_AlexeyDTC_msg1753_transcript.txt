Yeah, but also like in this case the company might decide to hire an AI engineer, right, who will
work together with data scientists, the data scientists on these things, right. But the data
scientists will also have these responsibilities of taking care of traditional machine learning,
maybe some legacy systems, but also some systems that they need now because because LLM is not the
answer to all the questions, right? So AI now is very good at solving a subset of some problems, but
there are so many problems that don't need LLMs, right? So we still need data scientists, we still
need machine learning engineers. They still need to work on what we, what they have been working on
many things. But some problems are of course simpler, like NLP is simpler, many things are simpler
now with LLMs.
