### Analysis of the Image

#### **1. Type**:
- **Type**: Screenshot
- **Platform**: Social media post, likely from LinkedIn.

#### **2. Main Content**:
- The main content is a reposted article or post by Phil Winder about his experience migrating a Python codebase to Go using an AI tool called Claude Code.

#### **3. Visible Text**:
```markdown
I just migrated a production Python codebase to Go using
Claude Code as the primary coding agent.

The project was Kodit, an MCP server for indexing code
repositories.

The code compiled, the tests passed, but it didn't work. No
surprise there right? It took a total of about 2 weeks to get
right.

The real value of this experience was learning what goes
wrong when you let an AI do a cross-language migration.
Dead code accumulation, phantom features rebuilt from
deprecated references, missing integration tests, context
window limits causing half-finished refactors.

Claude is a powerful but literal executor. The gaps in your
design become the bugs in your system.

I wrote up the full methodology, the automation script, and
everything that went wrong so you can learn from my
mistakes.
```

#### **4. Potential Use**:
- This screenshot could support an article or note about:
  - The challenges of using AI tools for cross-language code migration.
  - Lessons learned from migrating a production codebase from Python to Go.
  - The limitations and capabilities of AI coding agents like Claude Code.
  - Best practices for leveraging AI in software development and debugging.

Caption: По поводу вайбкодинга. У меня тот же опыт. Совсем если без контроля агента запустить, ничего не выйдет. Хоть сколько субагентов я создам, все равно надо ими управлять
