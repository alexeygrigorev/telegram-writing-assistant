### Analysis of the Image

#### **1. Type**
- **Type**: screenshot

#### **2. Main Content**
- The image appears to be a screenshot of a comment or message discussion, likely from a platform like Telegram or a forum. The main content is a response from a user named "dashad" discussing the use of Ghost (a platform for creators) for hosting online courses. The user provides insights on whether Ghost is suitable for different types of online course setups and suggests an alternative platform, Podia.

#### **3. Visible Text**
```markdown
That really depends on what you mean by “online courses.” If you mean different courses with different tiers and add-ons, then no, Ghost would not be an ideal solution (not right now, that is — more pricing options are likely coming someday in the future). If you mean simply putting content behind a paywall, with two pricing options as to how to access it (monthly or paid), then yes, it could work, but the use-case is focused mostly on “creators” (publishers, podcasters, journalists, visual storytellers, bloggers, etc.) who have a membership/subscription-driven site or content-driven publication.

It sounds like something like Podia would make more sense for your usecase. Again, Ghost is amazing. but you’re probably going to have to find some less-than-ideal workarounds to get set up with some features that online course platforms have already baked in, out of the box.
