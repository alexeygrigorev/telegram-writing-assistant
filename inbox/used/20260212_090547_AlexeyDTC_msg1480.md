# AI as Your Personal Analyst

## How I Automated Excel, Data Cleaning, and Student Selection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Short Announcement

In this talk, I'll share practical, real-world examples of how I use AI
to automate routine but time-consuming tasks --- without building
complex systems or hiring a team.

You'll learn:

-   How I replace complex Excel formulas and VLOOKUP chains with simple
    conversations in ChatGPT\
-   How to turn messy user input (like 100+ variations of country names)
    into clean, structured analytics\
-   How I automated the review of 1,500+ course applications using
    LLM-based scoring\
-   When ChatGPT is enough --- and when a local AI setup (CloudCode +
    Python) becomes more powerful

This is not about theory. It's about saving hours every week by treating
AI as your personal analyst and automation partner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Detailed Description

## 1. Introduction: AI as a Daily Automation Tool

I'm a programmer, but I don't want to spend hours writing and debugging
scripts for routine analytical tasks. Many of these problems are not
technically difficult --- they are simply time-consuming.

In the past, I would: - Write a Python script - Load data into pandas -
Perform joins, aggregations, and transformations - Debug edge cases -
Test everything carefully

Now, I describe the task in natural language --- and AI executes it.

The key idea:\
AI is not magic. It is an accelerator for problems you already
understand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Use Case #1: Replacing Complex Excel Logic with ChatGPT

### The Problem

My partner works in import/export, and her team frequently deals with
Excel spreadsheets involving:

-   Multiple tables\
-   Complex VLOOKUP formulas\
-   Data merges and aggregations\
-   Manual transformations

For me, as a developer, this is straightforward using Python and pandas.
But even simple tasks could take 1--1.5 hours when accounting for setup
and debugging.

### The New Approach

Instead of writing code manually:

1.  I upload the Excel files directly to ChatGPT.\
2.  I describe the required transformation in plain English.\
3.  ChatGPT writes and executes Python code internally.\
4.  It shows the resulting tables.\
5.  I iterate if necessary.

Result: 5--10 minutes instead of an hour.

In most cases, I don't even inspect the code. I focus only on the
outcome.

Key insight:\
ChatGPT acts as an interactive data analyst, not just a chatbot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Use Case #2: Country Name Normalization (Mini Project)

### The Problem

In my free courses, users register via a form and enter their country
manually. The input can vary wildly:

-   USA\
-   U.S.A.\
-   United States\
-   America\
-   US\
-   United States of America

For reporting and sponsor presentations, I need:

-   Clean country-level statistics\
-   Aggregation by regions (North America, Europe, etc.)\
-   Reliable structured data

### The Solution

Using ChatGPT:

-   I uploaded the dataset\
-   Asked it to generate a normalization mapping\
-   Refined the results\
-   Generated a reusable Python script

Over time, this evolved into a small internal project that:

-   Normalizes country names automatically\
-   Aggregates data by region\
-   Produces sponsor-ready statistics

Key takeaway:\
AI helps transform messy real-world data into structured insights
quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Use Case #3: Automating Scholarship Selection with CloudCode

This case required a more advanced setup.

### The Problem

For my paid course, I offer scholarships. In the first year:

-   1,500+ applications\
-   Long-form text answers\
-   Complex and partially subjective evaluation criteria

Manual review was extremely time-consuming.

### First Attempt (ChatGPT Only)

I copied submissions manually into ChatGPT and asked it to evaluate
them. It worked, but required too much manual effort.

### Current Solution (CloudCode + Local LLM Workflow)

Now I:

1.  Download the full dataset locally.\
2.  Use Python + CloudCode.\
3.  Create a sub-agent that:
    -   Analyzes all submissions\
    -   Scores them based on predefined criteria\
    -   Produces a ranking\
4.  Review the top 100 manually.

AI does not replace my judgment --- it filters noise and dramatically
reduces workload.

This saves dozens of hours per selection cycle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. When to Use ChatGPT vs. CloudCode

### ChatGPT is sufficient when:

-   Tasks are small or one-time\
-   You need quick Excel analytics\
-   Data sensitivity is not critical\
-   You don't want to configure a local environment

You only need a subscription.

### CloudCode is better when:

-   You work with large datasets\
-   You analyze text at scale\
-   The workflow is recurring\
-   You want full control over code\
-   Data must remain local

It requires Python setup, but once configured, AI writes most of the
code for you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Message

AI can function as:

-   A personal data analyst\
-   A workflow automation engine\
-   An information filter\
-   A force multiplier for your expertise

You don't need to be an ML engineer to use AI for automation.

The real question is:

Which repetitive task in your workflow could you delegate to AI
tomorrow?
