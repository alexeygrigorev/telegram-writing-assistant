## Analysis of Image

### Type
The image appears to be a **screenshot** of a social media post or forum discussion, likely from a platform like Twitter or a blog comment section.

### Main Content
The main content of the image is a text post by a user named WillBuckingham, discussing their experience with online course platforms, specifically comparing Ghost and Podia for hosting courses.

### Visible Text
```markdown
For stand-alone courses, ghost probably isn't the way to go. But I'm running a project which has access to ongoing philosophy courses by email for paid subscribers (with a linked Discourse forum), and free content for free subscribers.

As it is a hybrid, being half-way between an online course and a newsletter model, it's still quite early days, and I'm interested to see how it goes. You can have a look at what I'm doing here.

For another project, I also use Podia. But the courses there are stand-alone.
