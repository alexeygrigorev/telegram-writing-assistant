Now let's talk about data scientists. So for data scientists, what's the difference between data
scientists and AI engineers? So data scientists, they focus on training models, experimenting with
models, like running conducting experiments, translating the requirements from product to machine
learning terms, right? So they actually you work on creating this, creating data and so on, right?
So when it comes to AI, and by AI, I mean now using these LLMs, the model is already there. People
from OpenAI trained the model, so they went through the process. We don't need this. So in cases
when we do something simple, when we don't need to fine tune, when we don't need to like do anything
else. We don't really need data scientists in this case, right? It depends on the size of the
organization, but if we talk about a small AI team, don't really need data scientists here. However,
I wanna also talk about cases where data scientists actually do this. And I'm talking about bigger
organizations.
