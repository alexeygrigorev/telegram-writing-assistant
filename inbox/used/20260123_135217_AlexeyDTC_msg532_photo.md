### Type
The image is a **screenshot** of a terminal window, specifically showing a GNU nano editor session.

### Main Content
The main content of the image is a Bash configuration file (`.bashrc`) being edited in GNU nano. The file contains several alias definitions and a function named `claude_init`.

### Visible Text
```bash
alias c="claude"
alias cc="claude -c"
alias csp="claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
alias ccsp="claude -c --dangerously-skip-permissions"

claude_init() {
  local src="$HOME/.claude/CLAUDe_COPY.md"
  local dest="$PWD/CLAUDe.md"

  if [[ -e "$dest" ]]; then
    echo "CLAUDe.md already exists in this directory. Nothing done."
    return 0
  fi

  cp "$src" "$dest" || return 1
  echo "Init successful: CLAUDe.md created."
}
```
