Let's think about the roles, who exactly is involved there. So business understanding is product
managers, data understanding is data analysts and product managers, data preparation, data
engineers, modeling is strictly AI engineers, evaluation is AI engineers, product managers and
analysts, deployment is AI engineers. Here I didn't mention any backend engineers, but they are of
course there. also platform engineers. Also for business understanding, data understanding, we have
AI engineers. So AI engineers are involved in pretty much every step. So the first step, they help
PM to understand if it's something AI can solve. They can, together with analysts, they help to come
up with a good metric. Data understanding is together with analysts, AI engineers, they try to
understand, or could be anyone, could be backend engineers too are also involved. So pretty much the
entire team is involved. You can also involve, and will probably involve people from other teams if
you need data from there. Data preparation, as I said, data engineers and AI engineers. If you don't
have a data engineer in the team, AI engineer will need to do this. Now modeling strictly data
engineer, or AI engineer, sorry, evaluation AI engineer with some input from, Oh no, it's analyst
and the engineer together. So analysts will help to set up this AAB test. PM also needs to be
involved because they need to double check that we track the right metrics, right? So like we need
to set up the experiment properly. Yeah, in teams where we don't have AI engineers, these
responsibilities would be split between AI engineers and ML engineers.
