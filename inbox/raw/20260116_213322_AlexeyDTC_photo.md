        The image displays a list of changes made to a program, likely a changelog or commit message. The list includes:

* A summary of changes from two new transcripts
* Three main points:
	+ Image descriptions
	+ Reply with description
	+ Code cleanup

The background is black, and the text is white. A gray box at the bottom contains a command prompt with the text "there's new feedback in messages". 

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface, possibly from a development environment.
