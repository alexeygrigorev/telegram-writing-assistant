# AI Hero Email Course

The AI Hero email course provides practical knowledge that students can directly apply in their professional work. The course covers advanced AI concepts including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in LLM (Large Language Model) applications.

## Student Success

Students who complete the AI Hero email course, often alongside other Zoomcamp courses, successfully transition to AI engineering roles. Revathy, after completing both ML Zoomcamp and AI Hero course, landed a job as an AI Engineer at a startup following a career break of more than 7 years[^1].

## Real-World Application

The course content directly applies to job assignments. Revathy's first assignment in her new AI Engineer role was to implement RAG in LLM - a core topic covered in the AI Hero email course[^2].

The email course format allows students to learn at their own pace while gaining knowledge that is immediately relevant to professional settings.
