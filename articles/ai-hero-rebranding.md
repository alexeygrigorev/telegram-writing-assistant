# AI Hero Course Rebranding for AI Shipping Labs

Rebranding the existing AI Hero course to fit under the new AI Shipping Labs community. This involves transferring the course, its mailing list, and creating the right infrastructure.

See also: [Paid AI Engineers Community Planning](paid-ai-community-planning.md) for the overall community strategy.

## Transferring AI Hero to AI Shipping Labs

We need another mailing list, but we already have so many. The plan is to transfer AI Hero to AI Shipping Labs. AI Hero course becomes AI Shipping Labs - a rebranding so that people on the existing AI Hero mailing list don't wonder why they suddenly start receiving strange emails[^1].

## Hosting and Payment

It's a shame that Upstack didn't work out - it would have been the ideal option for this. There are other options for hosting and payments that still need to be explored. There are probably options that include a mailing list as well[^2].

## Certificates

AI Hero certificates haven't been made yet - there's never been enough time. They can now be created under the new community format. This gives a fresh start for the certificate design[^3].

## Community Discussion Platform

The AI Hero course currently has links to the DataTalks Club Slack. This needs to change. One option is to create GitHub Discussions specifically for AI Hero. The course can remain free so people can take it, and it serves as a lead magnet. Since people may have questions, GitHub Discussions dedicated to the AI Hero course would work as a support channel[^3].

## Free Activities as Lead Magnets

Some free activities can be organized every two to three months, like doing the AI Hero course and other similar things. Emails about these activities and about what happens in the paid community would be sent to the mailing list. This motivates people to upgrade and buy access to the community[^4].
