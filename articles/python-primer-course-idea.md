# Python Primer Course Idea

An idea for a paid Python prerequisite course to prepare students for AI Engineering and Zoomcamp courses.

## Origin Story

The idea came from a conversation with a student who is both working as a salesperson and studying data science. This student was struggling with Python and spending excessive time asking Claude for explanations. The plan was to schedule a call to understand their specific challenges in more detail[^1].

## Problem Analysis

Students entering AI Engineering Buildcamp and various Zoomcamps need a certain level of Python proficiency to be successful. The goal is to analyze all existing courses to identify the minimum Python requirements:

- AI Engineering Buildcamp
- ML Zoomcamp
- Data Engineering Zoomcamp
- AI DevTools Zoomcamp

All these courses likely have similar Python requirements[^2].

## Course Concept

The vision is a focused Python primer course that gets students to the proficiency level needed for AI Engineering and Zoomcamp participation.

### Teaching Philosophy

Based on experience, the best way to learn anything is through projects, not just reading books. While there are many excellent Python books like ThinkPython, they don't typically use a project-based approach[^4].

Each module would include:
1. An instructor-led demo project
2. A homework assignment where students build something similar but not identical - requiring them to think for themselves rather than copying and pasting[^6]

### Business Model

Several key decisions about the course format:

- Paid course (not free)
- Affordable pricing - approximately 50-100 euros
- Self-paced evergreen content (no cohorts)
- Automated delivery with minimal instructor involvement
- Time investment: 2-3 evenings to create
- Goal: Test if this concept is viable before expanding to other topics like Git[^8]

### Distribution Strategy

The course serves as a funnel:
1. Students purchase the affordable Python primer
2. They enjoy the course and feel they've already invested
3. This increases likelihood of purchasing the main AI Engineering course

The course could also be offered as a lead magnet - some content free, with paid upgrade option[^3].

## Why Not Under Data Talks Club

There are strategic reasons for keeping this separate from Data Talks Club:

1. If it's a paid product, it shouldn't live under Data Talks Club
2. Data Talks Club courses are open/free and expect students to come with some Python experience
3. A free Python course under Data Talks Club would attract complete beginners who aren't qualified for the paid courses
4. These beginners cannot be converted to paying customers for sponsors[^5]

## Format Decisions

### No Video Content

Unlike AI DevTools Zoomcamp which required significant recording time, this course would be text-based with minimal video. This significantly reduces time investment. The positioning: video courses cost more, text-based courses are more affordable[^10].

### Reference Material

Paul Iusztin (the Romanian AI educator) has a similar vision - learning Python through projects. His LinkedIn post suggests building small, complete tools like:
- Personal finance dashboard
- Automation scripts for boring tasks
- Mini ETL pipeline pulling data from APIs
- File organizer that reads spreadsheets and plots charts[^9]

The approach emphasizes that when learning Python for AI engineering, syntax isn't the goal - building things is.

## Potential Expansion

If this concept works, similar prerequisite courses could be created for other tools students commonly request help with (like Git)[^8].
