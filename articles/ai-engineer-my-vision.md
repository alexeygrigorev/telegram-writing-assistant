# AI Engineer My Vision

This article describes my personal vision of the AI engineer role, based on my own experience rather than industry surveys or external data.

## Context

I'm preparing for a "Day of AI Engineer" event and want to share how I see this role. The high interest in previous posts about webinars confirmed there's appetite for this content. Rather than relying on others' data or surveys, I want to describe the role from my direct experience.

## What AI Engineers Do

### Solving Real Problems with AI

Let me illustrate with a concrete example. Consider an online marketplace site with classified ads. The task is to integrate AI capabilities into this platform.

The AI engineer's approach involves:

1. **Understanding the problem** - What exactly are we trying to solve? What would success look like?

2. **Prompt engineering** - Crafting effective prompts to get the desired behavior from AI models

3. **Experimentation** - This is critical. AI engineering requires continuous experimentation through A/B testing. We show a new feature to a portion of traffic, measure how users respond, and iterate based on results[^1]

### Key Differentiators

What makes AI engineering different from traditional software engineering?

- **Prompt engineering** replaces traditional model training approaches
- **API-based interaction** with models like OpenAI rather than training from scratch
- **Rapid experimentation cycles** - faster iteration than traditional ML

### What AI Engineers Don't Focus On

Unlike traditional ML engineers, AI engineers typically don't:
- Fine-tune models from scratch
- Build custom model architectures
- Focus heavily on feature engineering in the traditional ML sense

Instead, they focus on:
- Engineering best practices for AI systems
- Effective prompt design and versioning
- Integration of AI capabilities into products
