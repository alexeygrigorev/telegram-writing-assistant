# Social Post Ideas

A collection of interesting social media posts and content ideas for newsletters, curated for future reference and inspiration.

## AI Projects for 2026

Post by Rimsha Bhardwaj: "10 AI projects that will get you hired in 2026" - a comprehensive list of project ideas with tech stacks and learning resources[^1].

The projects cover:
1. RAG App with Real Evaluations - OpenAI/Claude + vector DB + evals
2. Autonomous Research Agent - LangGraph + tools + citations
3. AI Customer Support Copilot - OpenAI + Zendesk/Intercom + moderation
4. Voice AI Agent - Twilio + Whisper + LLM
5. AgentOps Dashboard - OpenTelemetry + evals
6. AI Data Extraction Pipeline - Vision models + schema validation
7. Code Review AI for GitHub - GitHub Actions + LLM
8. Multi-Agent Planner for Workflows - LangGraph or CrewAI
9. AI Search Engine with Fresh Data - Search APIs + rerankers
10. Enterprise Prompt Security Tool - policy checks + red teaming

This aligns well with AI Engineering Buildcamp content and could be adapted into a "projects list" format.

## LLM Engineering Roadmap

Post by Inference: "The LLM Engineering Roadmap" - a structured learning path from foundations to production[^2].

The roadmap covers 10 stages:
1. LLM Foundations - Python/TypeScript, APIs, prompt engineering, structured outputs, function calling
2. Vector Stores - Embedding models, vector databases, chunking strategies, similarity search
3. RAG - Orchestration frameworks, document ingestion, retrieval methods, reranking
4. Advanced RAG - Query transformation, HyDE, corrective RAG, self-RAG, graph RAG
5. Fine-Tuning - Data preparation, LoRA/QLoRA/DoRA, SFT/DPO/RLHF, training tools
6. Inference Optimization - Quantization, serving engines, KV cache, flash attention, speculative decoding
7. Deployment - GPU scheduling, cloud platforms, Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI
8. Observability - Tracing, latency tracking, token usage, cost tracking
9. Agents - Frameworks, function calling, memory systems, patterns
10. Production and Security - Prompt injection defense, guardrails, semantic caching, fallbacks

This could be adapted specifically for AI Engineering Buildcamp as a roadmap variant.
