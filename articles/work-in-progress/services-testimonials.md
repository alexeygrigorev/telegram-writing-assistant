# Services Website Testimonials

Collection of testimonials for the services website. Saved here to avoid losing them due to Slack's 90-day retention period[^1].

## Tom Mac, Ex-Co-founder, Ibasho

"I met Alexey Grigorev at a DataTalks.Club meetup in Berlin and later reached out for help with our property price prediction model. In a one-hour session, he quickly understood our setup, asked great questions, and suggested clear improvements. His ideas were practical, easy to implement, and noticeably improved the model. I'd recommend him for hands-on, no-nonsense AI help."[^1]
