## Resource Format

Each resource entry follows this simple format:
- Title: the resource name (what it is)
- One paragraph description: what it does and why it's useful
- Keep it concise, 2-4 sentences max
- No bulleted lists, no code examples, no extra sections

## AI Development Tools

### Claude Code and Large-Context Reasoning

Materials from a hands-on O'Reilly Live Learning course by Tim Warner that teaches how to build production-ready AI-assisted development workflows with Claude Code. It covers large-context reasoning, MCP-based persistent memory, agents, and custom skills, with practical examples for code review, automation, and CI/CD[^1].

### awesome-slash

A curated GitHub list of tools, patterns, and projects built around slash-command interfaces. It's a practical reference for anyone designing command-driven workflows, bots, or developer tools that rely on concise, action-oriented commands instead of complex UIs[^1].

### Codex

An AI-powered CLI tool by antirez for complex debugging, code analysis, and technical questions. It handles file-based input for complex problems and can help with debugging subtle bugs, analyzing algorithms against specifications, and providing detailed code reviews[^2].

## Planning and Development Tools

### planning-with-files

A Claude Code skill that implements Manus-style persistent markdown planning. This is the workflow pattern behind Manus, the AI agent company that Meta acquired for $2 billion. The plugin transforms your workflow to use persistent markdown files for planning, progress tracking, and knowledge storage. It supports multiple IDEs including Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Continue, and more[^6].

### Atomic Agents

A lightweight and modular framework for building AI agent pipelines and applications. Built on Instructor and Pydantic, Atomic Agents focuses on atomicity where each component (agent, tool, context provider) is single-purpose, reusable, composable, and predictable. It enables creating AI applications using familiar software engineering principles with clear input and output schemas for consistent behavior[^7].
