## Resource Format

Each resource entry follows this simple format:
- Title: the resource name (what it is)
- One paragraph description: what it does and why it's useful
- Keep it concise, 2-4 sentences max
- No bulleted lists, no code examples, no extra sections

## AI Development Tools

### Claude Code and Large-Context Reasoning

Materials from a hands-on O'Reilly Live Learning course by Tim Warner that teaches how to build production-ready AI-assisted development workflows with Claude Code. It covers large-context reasoning, MCP-based persistent memory, agents, and custom skills, with practical examples for code review, automation, and CI/CD[^1].

### awesome-slash

A curated GitHub list of tools, patterns, and projects built around slash-command interfaces. It's a practical reference for anyone designing command-driven workflows, bots, or developer tools that rely on concise, action-oriented commands instead of complex UIs[^1].

### Codex

An AI-powered CLI tool by antirez for complex debugging, code analysis, and technical questions. It handles file-based input for complex problems and can help with debugging subtle bugs, analyzing algorithms against specifications, and providing detailed code reviews[^2].
