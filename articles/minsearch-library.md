# Minsearch: Simple Search for Small Datasets

A lightweight search library for small to medium datasets when you don't need the complexity of Elasticsearch.

## Origin Story

I created minsearch when preparing a workshop that needed to run on Google Colab. Colab doesn't support Docker, and you can't easily run Elasticsearch. I needed a simpler alternative[^1].

## Use Cases

Minsearch is designed for situations where:
- You have a small to medium-sized database
- You need search functionality
- Everything is within a single process
- You don't need heavy infrastructure like Elasticsearch[^2]

## Applications

Initially created for courses, minsearch is now used in many places:
- Course materials and workshops
- File bot - checks if a problem already exists in FAQ before adding it
- Any in-process search needs[^3]

## Source

Available as a Python library for simple search needs.
