# AI Engineer Role Research

Research into the AI Engineer and Gen AI Engineer roles in the industry, covering what these positions entail, what companies are looking for, and the interview process.

## Research Origin

The idea for this research came from an Office Hours session where a student actively asked for examples of home assignments used in AI Engineer job interviews. This type of content tends to resonate well both for the course and for social media[^1].

## Research Approach

The research uses multiple data sources to build a comprehensive picture of the AI Engineer role:

1. Job postings from the last three months for AI and Gen AI Engineer positions
2. Analysis of requirements and technologies from these postings
3. Stories from people on Reddit about what they do in their roles
4. Personal anecdotes from people I know in the industry
5. Interview questions shared on Twitter and Reddit

The goal is to aggregate data rather than rely on anecdotal evidence alone, to get an accurate picture of what the role actually entails[^2].

## Planned Article Series

The research will be organized into multiple focused articles:

### Article 1: The AI Engineer Role

Focuses on what the role is, what AI Engineers do in their day-to-day work, and how the position is defined in the industry. This is based on job postings, Reddit discussions, and aggregated information from multiple sources[^3].

### Article 2: Role Requirements and Position Definition

Covers what companies want when they hire AI and Gen AI Engineers. Based on job posting analysis, this article will detail the requirements and technologies that companies are looking for[^4].

### Article 3: Interview Process

Focuses on how interviews look for AI Engineer positions. Based on:
- Questions people are actually asking in interviews
- Posts from Reddit and Twitter
- Personal websites where people share their experiences
- Real interview stories rather than generic lists of 100 questions

The focus is on real experiences rather than compiling existing question banks without clear sources[^5].

### Article 4: Home Assignments

Analyzes GitHub repositories where people share their solutions to AI Engineer home assignments. This will show:
- What types of assignments companies give
- What technologies candidates use
- What's expected in these assignments

The focus is on understanding what assignments are given, not necessarily the solutions themselves[^6].

## Additional Applications

The research material can also be used for:
- Lightning lessons on Maven about interview breakdown
- Course content about AI Engineer careers
- Articles that can be shared and promoted

## Using Deep Research Agents

I experimented with deep research agents from both Google and OpenAI to help with data collection. The results were mixed:
- They didn't fully deliver on finding 100 GitHub repositories as requested
- They often found one result and hallucinated the rest
- However, they were useful for crafting better search queries for GitHub

For Twitter and Reddit analysis, deep research agents were more helpful because:
- Twitter/X (via Grok) has good access to recent interview question discussions
- People often share "just got asked this in my interview" content
- This content is valuable for real interview preparation

The current approach involves using agents to help craft search queries, then manually finding and aggregating the actual data sources for local analysis[^7].
