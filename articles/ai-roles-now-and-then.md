# AI Roles Now and Then

This article compares traditional data team roles with the emerging AI engineer role, examining how responsibilities have shifted with the rise of API-based AI.

## The Evolution of Data Roles

I previously wrote an article describing roles in data teams: Product Managers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, ML Engineers, and MLOps Engineers[^1]. That article is 5-6 years old now, and things have changed.

## What Changed

### The Disappearing Data Scientist

The traditional Data Scientist role is becoming less relevant in AI teams. Why? Because we're no longer training models from scratch. Instead, we make API calls to providers like OpenAI.

The focus has shifted from:
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Feature engineering for traditional ML
- Building custom model architectures

To:
- Engineering practices - how to properly integrate AI into systems
- Evaluation - measuring AI system performance
- Prompt versioning - managing prompt evolution
- Experimentation - A/B testing AI features

### Data Scientists Become AI Engineers

Data Scientists are well-positioned to transition to AI engineering. The skills that transfer:

- Evaluation - Data scientists have always measured model performance
- Versioning - They understand the importance of tracking experiments
- Experimental mindset - A/B testing and iterative improvement

What they need to add:
- Stronger coding skills
- Understanding of AI APIs and prompt engineering
- Production engineering practices

### ML Engineers Become AI Engineers

Similarly, ML Engineers can transition to AI engineering. Their foundation in:
- Productionizing models
- Engineering best practices
- Working with other engineering teams

Provides a solid base. What they need:
- Learn the specific patterns of AI Engineering Buildcamp
- Understand prompt engineering and evaluation for AI systems

The path from ML Engineer or Data Scientist to AI Engineer is straightforward because the foundational knowledge already exists[^2].

## Teams Without "AI" in the Name

Many companies don't have dedicated AI engineer roles. Instead, existing team members take on AI responsibilities:

- Data Scientists focus on designing experiments and evaluation
- ML Engineers focus more on monitoring and deployment

The job titles may be old, but the tasks are new. Instead of training models from scratch, they use OpenAI or similar APIs. Everything else remains the same[^3].

## Career Paths

For Data Scientists and ML Engineers, the transition to AI Engineer is natural:
- The base skills are already there
- The focus shifts from model training to prompt engineering
- Evaluation and experimentation remain core competencies

What we teach in AI Engineering Buildcamp covers exactly what's needed for this transition[^4].
