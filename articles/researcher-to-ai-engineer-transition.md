# How Researchers Can Transition to AI Engineering

This is an article idea about how people working in research can transition to AI engineering. To be continued.[^1]

## The Problem

For engineers, the transition to AI engineering is relatively straightforward. They already know a lot, and they have a solid foundation. They mostly need to do a few projects to fill the gaps.[^1]

But for people working in research - in university labs, for example - the transition is different. These people show up in every course cohort. At least one person per cohort comes from a research background.[^1]

They don't have the same engineering foundation. Things like tests, project structure, CI/CD - these are not part of their daily work. For them, things like sending API requests might actually be easier than setting up tests and structuring a project properly.[^1]

For these people, tools like AI Buildcamp might be more accessible as an entry point, since the barrier is lower on the engineering side.[^1]

## What Needs More Research

This topic needs more investigation because there are enough of these people in the courses to justify a dedicated article. The goal is to prepare a guide specifically for researchers on how to transition to AI engineering.[^1]
