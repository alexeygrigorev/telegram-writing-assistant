# Pet Projects

Andrej Karpathy shared advice on how to become an expert at something[^1]:

1. Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth-wise, learning "on demand" (do not learn bottom-up breadth-wise)
2. Teach and summarize everything you learn in your own words
3. Only compare yourself to your younger self, never to others
