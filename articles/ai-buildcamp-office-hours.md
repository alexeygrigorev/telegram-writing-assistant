# AI Build Camp Office Hours

## Overview

Office Hours are an integral part of the AI Build Camp course. They provide dedicated time for students to ask questions, get help with projects, receive guidance on optional materials, and engage with the instructor and fellow participants[^1].

## Logistics

The Office Hours information should be added to the first module of the course, specifically in the Logistics section where course structure and expectations are covered[^1].

## Format and Recording

Each Office Hours session is recorded, and the video is shared with all course participants. The recordings are made available to ensure that students who cannot attend live still have access to all the content and discussions[^1].

## Google Doc Resource

A shared Google Document accompanies each Office Hours session. This document contains:

- Summary of what was covered during the session
- Important links and resources discussed
- Follow-up information from weekly streams

After each weekly stream, links to the Google Doc are sent to all participants. Students can refer back to these documents at any time to review what was covered[^1].

## Asking Questions

There are multiple ways for students to ask questions during Office Hours:

### Live Participation

Students who attend Office Hours live can ask questions directly during the session. This is the most interactive way to get help and engage with the material[^2].

### Questions via Slides

For students who cannot attend live or prefer to prepare questions in advance, there is a mechanism to submit questions via slides:

- If students cannot make it to Office Hours, they can submit their questions through the slide submission system
- The instructor reads and addresses these questions during the live session
- This ensures that even absent students get their questions answered[^2]

### Questions from Other Platforms

Some questions may come from other sources like private chats or community channels. If the instructor receives a question that seems relevant and useful for many students, it will be brought up for discussion during Office Hours. This ensures that valuable questions reach the entire cohort, not just the individual who asked[^3].

## Topics Covered

During Office Hours, a variety of topics are addressed:

### Questions About Topics Not Covered in Course

Students can ask about topics that are not explicitly covered in the main course materials. The instructor provides guidance on these subjects and may recommend relevant videos or resources[^3].

### Optional Video Recommendations

The course curriculum includes both core and optional content. If a student is working on a specific project, the instructor can recommend which optional videos would be most relevant for them to watch. This personalized guidance saves students time by directing them to the most useful materials rather than having them search through everything themselves[^3].

### Code Help

Office Hours includes significant time dedicated to code-related questions. Students can get help with:

- Debugging issues
- Understanding code examples
- Implementing project features
- Best practices for code organization[^3]

### Project Discussions

Projects receive substantial attention starting from the very beginning of the course:

- By the second live session, project ideas are already being discussed
- Students are encouraged to participate in these discussions early
- Office Hours provide a venue for ongoing project work and feedback[^3]

## Attendance Policy

While attending Office Hours live is encouraged, it is not mandatory. All sessions are recorded and all resources (Google Docs, links, summaries) are shared afterwards. Students who cannot attend can still fully participate through the combination of recordings, documentation, and question submission mechanisms[^4].
