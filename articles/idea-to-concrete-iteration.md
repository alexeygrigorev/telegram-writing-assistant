# From Vague Ideas to Concrete Results with ChatGPT

A process for using ChatGPT to iterate from undefined, vague ideas into something concrete and actionable.

## Core Concept

When working through ideas, it can be valuable to document the iteration process. The process of taking something unclear and making it concrete through conversation with an AI assistant is itself worth documenting and sharing[^1].

This could be interesting for:
- Students learning to work with AI assistants
- Anyone who struggles with turning abstract thoughts into actionable plans
- People looking to improve their AI prompting and iteration skills

## Ongoing Development

This article is a placeholder for material on this topic. As relevant content accumulates, it will be added here[^1].
