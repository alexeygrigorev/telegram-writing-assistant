# Weekly Log

A running log of what was done each week. When a topic has its own detailed article, this log contains a short summary with a link. When there is not much content for a topic, the details go here directly.

## Week of 2026-02-24

Telegram Writing Assistant: added YouTube transcript processing and external audio file support. The bot can now accept audio files recorded outside of Telegram and process them through the same Whisper transcription pipeline. YouTube URL processing also works now. See [What's New in the Telegram Writing Assistant](ready-for-newsletter/telegram-writing-assistant-updates.md) for details[^1][^2].

PNG to SVG conversion: spent time converting a ChatGPT-generated PNG logo into SVG using Claude Code with OpenCV. Went through multiple approaches before finding one that works. See [Recreating a PNG Logo as SVG with Claude Code](svg-logo-recreation.md) for the full story[^3].
