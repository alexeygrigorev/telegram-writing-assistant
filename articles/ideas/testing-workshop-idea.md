## Testing Workshop Idea

I noticed many people struggle with testing. This relates to the testing content I've been working on. The problem is that not everyone has a good understanding of:

- How to use unit tests
- How to use integration tests
- How to write tests
- What needs testing and what doesn't
- Test-driven development

Many developers don't have this background. Software developers typically don't struggle because testing is commonly used in development work. But people with more scientific backgrounds, data science, or analytics often lack this experience. The more I work with AI Buildcamp and workshops, the more I see the need for foundational material covering these topics[^6].

I have the knowledge and accumulated material on this subject. The idea is to:

1. Create a testing workshop for NOW (the company)
2. Create testing material to promote AI Buildcamp
3. Cover different types of tests
4. Show how to do testing in Python
5. Include pytest, project setup, and best practices

This could even be split into multiple workshops:
- One on testing in general
- One on testing agents
- One on testing data pipelines

This idea is currently in the background as something close to implementation. Recording this message serves as a demonstration of how the bot works[^6].
