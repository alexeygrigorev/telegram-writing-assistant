# AI-Assisted Automation Course Idea

After spending significant time with AI assistants for automation, an idea is forming for a new course focused on AI-assisted automation. This would complement existing courses like AI DevTools Zoomcamp and ML Zoomcamp[^1].

## Course Concept

While the initial thought was "AI-assisted development," the focus is shifting toward "AI-assisted automation" - using AI to automate tasks including many aspects of development work[^1].

## Tool Preferences

For coding tasks specifically, Copilot's code output is preferred and more convenient to use. However, Claude Code excels at practically everything else - general automation tasks that go beyond just writing code[^1].

## Timeline

In a couple of months, there should be enough material to create a comprehensive course. The plan is to ask the audience about their interest level before committing to full development[^1].

## Course Format

If created, the course would likely be:
- Paid (complementing existing free content)
- Some topics offered as free webinars
- Structured knowledge building on AI DevTools Zoomcamp foundation[^1]

## Why Paid Courses

There are multiple reasons for preferring paid courses:

### Financial Reasons
- Additional income source - revenue from DataTalks Club isn't always sufficient
- Monetizing expertise and experience directly[^2]

### Audience Benefits
- AI DevTools Zoomcamp already provides free content with substantial value
- People who follow the link already learn a lot
- Paid course allows structuring knowledge more comprehensively[^2]

### Personal Motivation
- AI Buildcamp success demonstrates people are willing to pay for this expertise
- Students in paid courses tend to be more engaged
- Satisfaction from earning directly from knowledge and experience[^2]

This is a brainstorm/braindump format - some ideas may be developed further, others may not be suitable for publishing[^2].
