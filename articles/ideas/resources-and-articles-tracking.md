### Resource and Article Tracking

I had an idea to improve resource and draft tracking. Currently, resources are shared in the newsletter, but there's no easy way to see what has been shared and what hasn't. A potential solution:

1. Create a table (CSV or similar format) on GitHub to track resources
2. When sharing a resource link, ask the bot to categorize and add it to the table
3. Apply the same approach to draft articles the bot creates

This would create a Kanban-style tracking system with states like: To Do, Done, Backlog. It would be easier to see which articles have been worked on and which need attention[^6].
