## New Website Services Section

As part of preparing for future consulting and workshop work, I added a new "Workshops" section to my website. The content is currently AI-generated but will be updated with real testimonials and project examples[^2].

  <!-- Placeholder website section for future consulting services -->

The plan is for workshop certificates to include links to this page, so when participants share on LinkedIn, interested people can click through to learn about services.
