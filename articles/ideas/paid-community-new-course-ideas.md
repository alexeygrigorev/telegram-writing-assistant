# New Course Ideas for the Paid Community

Several ideas for courses that could be offered in the paid community.

## Specification-Driven Development for AI

A course about becoming a good product manager to effectively communicate with AI agents. The core insight: programmers now need to become good product managers to tell agents what to do. When the specification is not good, the agent produces garbage. If the agent misunderstands the request and does something completely different, it is the programmer's fault for not communicating clearly enough[^1].

The course would teach how to properly communicate to agents what they need to do and how to manage development when the team is made of agents[^1].

### Course structure

The course can cover software development methodologies more broadly - how teamwork happens, what roles exist in a team. Then map this to agents: you are now the product manager, the agents are the implementers[^2].

Topics to cover[^2]:
- How to set tasks in a way that is maximally clear
- What grooming is
- Product management in general
- Acceptance criteria - they must be clear
- Specifications - they must exist
- Kanban

### Final project

The course output will be a kanban board for agents - an application that everyone builds together throughout the course. The graduation project is to build any project of their choosing[^2].

There is already research on spec-driven development patterns and tools collected in the [Spec-Driven Development research article](../research/spec-driven-development.md).

## Data Engineering for AI

A course about building data pipelines for AI systems[^1].

## AI for Data Engineering

A course about using AI effectively to be a more efficient data engineer[^1].
