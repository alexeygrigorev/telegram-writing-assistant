# New Course Ideas for the Paid Community

Several ideas for courses that could be offered in the paid community.

## Specification-Driven Development for AI

A course about becoming a good product manager to effectively communicate with AI agents. The core insight: programmers now need to become good product managers to tell agents what to do. When the specification is not good, the agent produces garbage. If the agent misunderstands the request and does something completely different, it is the programmer's fault for not communicating clearly enough[^1].

The course would teach how to properly communicate to agents what they need to do and how to manage development when the team is made of agents[^1].

There is already research on spec-driven development patterns and tools collected in the [Spec-Driven Development research article](../research/spec-driven-development.md).

## Data Engineering for AI

A course about building data pipelines for AI systems[^1].

## AI for Data Engineering

A course about using AI effectively to be a more efficient data engineer[^1].
