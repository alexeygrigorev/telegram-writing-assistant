# Paid Community Marketing Plan

Ideas and planning for how to promote and market the paid community. These are initial ideas to build into a more systematic plan over time[^1].

## The Need for a Plan

We need to think about how to build a marketing plan and how we will promote the community. This is useful both for the course and for the community. Maven already has tools for this - things like Lightning Lessons and lead magnets. We will need to come up with all of this ourselves. Obviously we will use social media, but we can approach it more systematically and put together at least a rough promotion plan[^1].

## Marketing Funnel

A rough outline of the funnel, besides social media[^2]:

- SEO
- Lead magnets
- Free newsletter, where we advertise the paid community
- Short webinars to promote the community

## Lead Magnets

Based on the recent webinar, Learning Paths could work as lead magnets. For example, a Learning Path for Data Engineers or a Learning Path for Frontend Engineers. These could be published on Maven as well[^5].

## Community as a Funnel Step

The course price is quite high, so the level of trust people need to have is also high. Not everyone is ready to spend $1700 on someone they don't know well. A possible solution: let them first buy something small, see that they get a lot of value from it, and then buy something more expensive like the course[^6].

Right now there are a lot of people on the course waitlist, but only tenths of a percent actually convert. If we set up the funnel so that there is a community step in between, it helps in two ways. First, we already start generating revenue. Second, people get to know what happens in the community, their trust in us grows, and they end up buying the course[^6].

The community works as the intermediate step in the funnel that helps convert more people. Instead of going directly from awareness to a high-priced course, people enter through the community, experience value firsthand, and then upgrade[^6].

## Open Questions

There are still questions about where paid content will live - on Substack or on the website[^2].

## Content Strategy for Tiers

There will be a closed repository of event recordings from the community, written tutorials that come from those events, and all other materials shared in the closed community[^3].

The paid newsletter publishes these materials gradually for tier 1 members - not all at once, but in portions[^3].
