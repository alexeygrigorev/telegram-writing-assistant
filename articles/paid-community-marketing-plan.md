# Paid Community Marketing Plan

Ideas and planning for how to promote and market the paid community. These are initial ideas to build into a more systematic plan over time[^1].

## The Need for a Plan

We need to think about how to build a marketing plan and how we will promote the community. This is useful both for the course and for the community. Maven already has tools for this - things like Lightning Lessons and lead magnets. We will need to come up with all of this ourselves. Obviously we will use social media, but we can approach it more systematically and put together at least a rough promotion plan[^1].

## Marketing Funnel

A rough outline of the funnel, besides social media[^2]:

- SEO
- Lead magnets
- Free newsletter, where we advertise the paid community
- Short webinars to promote the community

## Open Questions

There are still questions about where paid content will live - on Substack or on the website[^2].

## Content Strategy for Tiers

There will be a closed repository of event recordings from the community, written tutorials that come from those events, and all other materials shared in the closed community[^3].

The paid newsletter publishes these materials gradually for tier 1 members - not all at once, but in portions[^3].
