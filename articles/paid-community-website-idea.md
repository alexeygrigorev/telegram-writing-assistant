## Community Website

Another idea is to create a dedicated community website. The plan:
1. Come up with a name for the community
2. Create a simple site to aggregate articles
3. Don't heavily promote it initially - just collect content
4. Focus on SEO to see how to build from scratch
5. Eventually use the site as a landing page for the community

This would be a place to publish all the articles being generated through this system, with proper SEO and organization from the ground up[^7].
